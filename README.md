## IceOS

My own command line OS. Based on tutorials and articles, since this is for learning

**Status:** IceOS v0.1b1 does not work! It's the first version to use the new files. Todo: Find a solution

<br>

### Building & Running

First build it with
```bash
sh Build.sh
```

Then get the newly built `iso` file from the `Builds` folder

### Contributing & Contributors

It would be really cool if you wanna help! Just make a pull request, and you should be fine

Currently there's only me working on the project, but I've got some help and advice from various people such as Dave
